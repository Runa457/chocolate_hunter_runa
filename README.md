### Hunt for chocolates!

Chocolate hunter Runa is addicted to chocolate.\
Help her earn chocolate through battle.

+ #### In the camp

  Runa must eat enough chocolate in a certain amount of time. She can extend her lifespan only if she eat chocolates.\
  She can make potions by extracting ingredients from chocolate to recover her health. But she cannot restore her life with potions.\
  Upgrading equipments by special magic costs a lot of chocolate, but it is worth it. Weapon and armor can be upgraded.

+ #### In the crossroad

  After each battle, you can choose one of the three paths to proceed.\
  Each path contains series of battles.

  You can check the total number of battles (S), the number of enemies (E), amount of chocolate enemies have (C).

+ #### In the battlefield

  She can fight with two types of attack.\
  Melee type attack is physical element attack. It costs nothing, but weak.

  She can use various magic to strengthen herself or attack the enemies.\
  Most magic consumes mana.\
  She learns one spell at each level.

  When battle is over, chocolates and experiences are gained.\
  The multiplier of the chocolates you get will decrease after every battle sequence.

  When the boss of stratum is defeated, game will proceed to next stratum, and multiplier is recovered.

+ #### Game over

  If health goes to zero or lifespan (turns) is over, the game is over.\
  You can see your current game's score and your best record ever.

+ #### Elements

  There are four types of elements: physical, fire, ice and lightning.\
  All enemies have resistance or weakness for each element.\
  Each attack has its element type.

+ #### Status effects

  Some attacks have the chance to cause status effects.\
  Types of status effects include raising/lowering stats, charge, guard, etc.

+ #### Codexes

  From the options menu, you can read the codexes for the enemies encountered and the spells learned.

+ #### Tips

  Each enemy has its own weaknesses and behavioral patterns.\
  Based on this information, you can gain the upper hand in battle.

  Avoiding enemies too much makes it difficult to deal with the boss later.\
  It can be advantageous to take out as many enemies as possible in your current state.
